# MathLibPy

This is a basic math library for Python.

It's a work in progress, but if you're interested in contributing, feel free to contact me at sharrackor@gmail.com.

## Requirements

This library uses Python 2.7x, along with Epydoc for documentation.

## Features

* Matrices
    * Arithmetic on matrices
    * Determinants and cofactors
    * Inverses (can handle zeros on main diagonal)
    * Echelon and (row) reduced Echelon form
* Functions
    * Polynomials
    * Trigonometric functions
    * Exponential function, logarithm
        * Arbitrary powers and logarithm bases
    * Function combination and composition (addition, division, etc.)
    * Differentiation
    * Exact function equality test (equal if internal structures equal)
* Sequences
    * Arithmetic and Geometric sequences
    * Generic sequence, takes any Function
* Discrete math
    * Finite Sets
    * Infinite sets
        * Real, Integer and Natural number sets
        * Sets of disjoint ranges (real and integer ranges)
    * Union, intersect, difference
    * Cardinality, subset, proper subset and equality tests
        * Returns different infinities for different infinite sets
* Infinities
    * Comparison of different infinities and with finite numbers
    * Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
* Irrational numbers from base values (pi, e, etc.)
